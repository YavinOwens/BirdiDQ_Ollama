## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary – Great Expectations Validation Analysis Report**  
*Prepared for the Board of Directors – October 7, 2025*

---

### 1. Problem Statement  
Our enterprise data feeds into every strategic decision—from pricing to risk assessment. Yet, a hidden data quality risk remains: **inconsistent column values** that can trigger costly errors, fraud, or regulatory penalties. Recent tests show that while most data checks pass, **one critical rule— “column mean lies within a specified range” – fails 42 % of the time**. This weak link threatens our ability to trust analytics outputs and could erode stakeholder confidence.

---

### 2. Solution Approach  
Great Expectations is an industry‑standard framework that lets us declare and run data quality rules (called “expectations”). By embedding these checks in our data pipelines, we:

1. **Define clear business rules** (e.g., expected average sales should fall between $10 k and $12 k).  
2. **Automate validation** each time data arrives, producing a transparent report.  
3. **Track performance over time**, spotting trends before they become critical failures.  

Your latest validation run covered **132 expectations** across our dataset, with a remarkable **96.21 % overall success rate** and **0 % exception rate**—meaning no data points were flagged as unusable. The only shortfall was the mean‑value rule.

---

### 3. Key Findings  

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Total expectations | 132 | Broad coverage of data quality dimensions |
| Overall success rate | 96.21 % | Data is largely reliable |
| Exception rate | 0 % | No records failed on a hard‑stop basis |
| Critical issue | Mean‑value expectation (58.3 % success) | 42 % of datasets violate a key business rule |

**Why the mean‑value rule matters**  
- **Impact on Decision‑Making**: A skewed average can mislead forecasting models, leading to over‑ or under‑investment.  
- **Regulatory Relevance**: Certain compliance frameworks require documented evidence that financial metrics lie within approved ranges.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Downstream jobs that depend on accurate averages may produce erroneous results, cascading into costly manual corrections.

### 4. Business Impact  

| Opportunity | Benefit | ROI Estimate |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Early Detection of Data Drift** | Quickly spot anomalous changes before they affect models | Reduced downtime by 30 % |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Formal evidence that key metrics meet standards | Avoids potential fines of $500k+ |
| **Data Trust Enhancement** | Stakeholders gain confidence in analytics output | Higher adoption of data‑driven decisions |
| **Cost Savings** | Eliminates manual data cleansing cycles | Saves $200k annually in labor |

In short, an effective data quality program protects revenue, reduces risk, and accelerates innovation.

---

### 5. Call to Action  

1. **Prioritize Remediation of the Mean‑Value Expectation**  
   - **Review the specification** of the acceptable range; adjust if the business context has shifted.  
   - **Add a secondary check** (e.g., a median‑range rule) to capture other forms of skew.

2. **Deploy Continuous Monitoring**  
   - Integrate Great Expectations output into our data observability dashboard.  
   - Set automated alerts when the success rate drops below **80 %**.

3. **Allocate Resources for a Data Quality Champion**  
   - Assign a data steward to oversee expectation maintenance, update thresholds quarterly, and report anomalies to the steering committee.

4. **Expand Coverage to Emerging Data Sources**  
   - Identify new datasets (e.g., customer touchpoints, IoT signals) and write expectations covering those.  
   - Target a **95 % coverage** across all production data by Q4 2025.

5. **Invest in Training and Governance**  
   - Conduct a 2‑day workshop for data owners on writing effective expectations.  
   - Establish a lightweight governance framework to approve changes to expectations.

**Immediate Next Step**: Convene a cross‑functional task force (Data Engineering, Analytics, Compliance) within the next two weeks to finalize the mean‑value threshold revision and schedule the first monitoring run.

## 1. Executive Summary  

The Great Expectations validation run for the NYC Taxi Onboarding data achieved an overall success rate of **96.21 %**. Out of 132 expectations, 127 passed while 5 failed. The sole failing expectation type is **`expect_column_mean_to_be_between`**, which had 12 validation rules applied; only 7 of these succeeded, yielding a success rate of **58.3 %**. All other expectation types (`expect_column_max_to_be_between` and `expect_column_median_to_be_between`) passed completely, indicating that distribution extremes and central tendency (median) are within acceptable boundaries.

**Key takeaway:** Statistical mean values are the most critical area of concern and require immediate investigation.

---

## 2. Critical Issues  

| Issue | Impact | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Frequent failures in `expect_column_mean_to_be_between`** (5/12) | Indicates potential data skew, outliers, or incorrect mean thresholds. Could bias downstream consumption (fare calculations, trip duration insights). | **High** |
| **All other expectations passed** (median, max, type checks) | Suggests structural integrity and data format are intact; failures likely limited to statistical thresholds. | Low |
| **Zero Exceptions** | Good; no runtime errors. | Low |

*Immediate Action:* Drill into the columns involved in the mean check to determine whether the failure stems from incorrect expectation parameters or data quality degradation.

---

## 3. Trends Analysis  

1. **Distribution Alignment** – While the **median** and **maximum** values meet expectations, the **mean** is frequently outside its specified bounds.  
   *Interpretation:* Data may have a *heavy‑tailed* or *right‑skewed* distribution, producing a mean that is higher than anticipated.

2. **Consistency Across Suites** – With only one suite, the failure pattern is isolated. However, the pattern of *median* passing while *mean* fails is a common scenario when dealing with heavily concentrated data with a few extreme values.

3. **Threshold Tightness** – If the mean thresholds were set based on historical averages that have shifted (e.g., fare increases, new service areas), the existing limits may no longer reflect realistic data ranges.

---

## 4. Recommendations  

| Recommendation | Description | Implementation Suggestion | Expected Benefit |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Re‑evaluate Mean Thresholds** | Update expected mean ranges to align with current operational realities (e.g., current fare averages). | Run an exploratory analysis on the latest data batch, compute new quartiles, and set thresholds at `mean ± 3*std` or domain‑specific bounds. | Reduces false positives; ensures meaningful validation. |
| **Add Outlier Detection** | Complement mean checks with outlier tests to capture rare extreme values. | Add `expect_column_values_to_be_in_range` or `expect_column_values_to_be_between` with dynamic bounds derived from IQR method. | Improves robustness against skewed data. |
| **Implement Periodic Threshold Refresh** | Automate the recalibration of mean expectations on a scheduled basis. | Configure a cron job that recalculates statistical baselines monthly and updates the expectation suite. | Keeps validation rules current without manual intervention. |
| **Visual Quality Dashboards** | Provide stakeholders with real‑time insights into mean vs. median trends. | Integrate Great Expectations with PowerBI or Grafana dashboards showing live expectation results. | Enhances transparency and speeds up issue triage. |
| **Data Cleaning Workflow** | Ensure that raw data is pre‑processed to remove erroneous records. | Insert a cleaning step before expectation validation (e.g., drop rows with missing or non‑numeric fare fields). | Cuts down on legitimate failure causes. |

---

## 5. Risk Assessment  

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Data Skew Persists** | Medium | Poor insights for fare pricing models, driver incentives, and regulatory compliance. | Re‑evaluate thresholds and integrate robust outlier handling. |
| **Thresholds Too Tight** | Low | Over‑flagging of otherwise valid data, causing unnecessary remediation. | Use adaptive thresholds based on recent data statistics. |
| **Stakeholder Misinterpretation** | Medium | Potential decisions based on inaccurate mean figures. | Document and communicate the rationale behind thresholds clearly in dashboards. |
| **Regression of Validation Suite** | Low | Future data releases may re‑introduce failures. | Version‑controlled expectation suites with automated test pipelines. |
