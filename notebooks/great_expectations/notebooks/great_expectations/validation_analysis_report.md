# Great Expectations Data Quality Report  
**Run ID:** `20251005T180117.592126Z`  
**Date of report:** October 7 2025  

> **Scope** – Validation run on the *nyc_taxi_data_onboarding_suite_final* suite (132 expectation checks) covering a single‑record snapshot of the NYC taxi dataset.  

---

## 1. Executive Summary  

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Expectations | 132 |
| Successful Expectations | 127 |
| Failure Rate | 3.79 % |
| Success Rate | 96.21 % |
| Exceptions | 0 |
| Suite Count | 1 |

The validation run demonstrates **overall good data quality**. 96 % of expectations pass and there are **no runtime exceptions**, indicating that the underlying schema and ingest process are functioning as expected.  

The sole source of concern is **mean‑value expectations**:

* 12 mean expectations were defined, of which only 7 passed (58 % success).  
* All maximum‑value and median‑value expectations passed at 100 %.  

The mean‑value failures suggest that **some columns have average values that lie outside the declared ranges** (e.g. `total_amount`, `trip_distance`, etc.).  These deviations do not represent a systemic data‑integrity problem (no schema violations, no missing columns), but they may affect downstream analytics that rely on statistically‑derived metrics.  

---

## 2. Critical Issues  

| Issue | Why it matters | Impact |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Mean expectation failures (5 out of 12)** | Indicates that the statistical distribution of key columns is not within the acceptable bounds defined by business rules or previous historical averages. | Possible mis‑interpretation of fare amounts, trip metrics, or driver incentives; risk of incorrect business decisions or KPI reporting. |
| **Single‑timestamp data snapshot** | The current run covers a single data point (2025‑10‑05 18:01:17).  No temporal trend analysis is possible from this snapshot alone, limiting validation depth. | Inability to detect seasonality, drift, or gradual degradation across epochs. |
| **No exceptions reported** | While good for overall integrity, it may mask underlying data issues that do not trigger validation errors—for instance, unexpected nulls in hidden columns or foreign‑key mis‑references not covered by the suite. | Potential for silent data quality drift in future runs. |

---

## 3. Trends Analysis  

| Trend | Observation | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Consistent high success for structural checks** | All column‑maximum, median, and basic existence checks passed. | The schema is stable and consistent with expectations. |
| **Inconsistent statistical checks** | Mean checks have a 58 % pass rate whereas max/median checks pass at 100 %. | Likely due to outlier or drift in underlying data values, not necessarily a structural issue. |
| **Temporal limitation** | Validation window is a single second; no historical comparison possible. | Future runs should span multiple days or weeks to surface performance trends. |
| **Zero‑exception rate** | No test failures due to runtime exceptions. | Provides confidence that the validation harness is configured correctly. |

---

## 4. Recommendations  

| Recommendation | Target | Action Steps | Owner |
|----------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Adjust mean expectation ranges** | Columns with failing mean checks | • Validate current bounds against recent historical data (last 7 days). <br>• Re‑calculate means for each column and update `expect_column_mean_to_be_between` thresholds accordingly. | Data Engineering |
| **Implement dynamic expectation calibration** | All statistical expectations | • Add a pre‑validation step that calculates current statistics and automatically updates expectation ranges (e.g., using a percentile‑based approach). <br>• Schedule calibration weekly. | Data Ops |
| **Expand benchmark windows** | Validation suite | • Extend the `batch_kwargs` to fetch a 7‑day window (or hourly buckets) rather than a single timestamp. <br>• Add expectation types that detect trend drift (`expect_column_mean_to_change_by`). | Analytics |
| **Introduce anomaly detection** | Emerging patterns | • Add `expect_column_mean_to_be_increasing` or `expect_column_mean_to_be_decreasing` to detect unexpected reversals. | Data Quality Team |
| **Schedule automated alerts** | Mean expectation failures | • Configure Slack or email alerts when any mean expectation fails. | Data Ops |
| **Review data ingestion pipeline** | Data quality continuity | • Conduct a root‑cause analysis of the mean outliers: data source changes, transformations, or data source integrity. | ETL Developers |
| **Document expectation rationale** | Governance | • Create documentation linking each expectation to a business requirement. This aids future stakeholders in understanding the purpose of bounds. | Knowledge Base |

## 5. Risk Assessment  

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Statistical bias in downstream analytics** | Medium | High | Tighten mean expectations, periodic calibration. |
| **Undetected data drift** | Low | Medium | Expand batch window and add drift‑detection expectations. |
| **Operational disruption due to false positives** | Low | Low | Validate adjusted thresholds against stakeholders before deployment. |
| **Increased maintenance overhead** | Medium | Medium | Automate expectation updates via CI/CD pipeline. |
| **Loss of stakeholder trust** | Low | High | Communicate changes, provide evidence of improved accuracy. |

| 2 | **Re‑calculate and update mean thresholds** | Data Engineering | 2025‑10‑20 |
| 3 | **Implement automated calibration of statistical expectations** | Data Ops | 2025‑10‑25 |
| 4 | **Extend validation window to 7 days** | Analytics | 2025‑10‑28 |
| 5 | **Add drift‑detection expectations** | Data Quality Team | 2025‑11‑02 |
| 6 | **Deploy alerting mechanism for mean failures** | Data Ops | 2025‑11‑05 |
| 7 | **Generate stakeholder briefing on updated expectations** | Knowledge Base | 2025‑11‑07 |

### Closing Remarks  

The current validation shows that the **structural integrity of the dataset is intact**, but **statistical expectations on mean values require adjustment** to better reflect the observed data distribution. Proactively calibrating these expectations and expanding the temporal scope of validation will provide more robust, actionable insights and mitigate the risk of inaccurate reporting.
