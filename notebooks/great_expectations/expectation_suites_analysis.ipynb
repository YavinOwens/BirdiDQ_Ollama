        "# Great Expectations Expectation Suites Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook reads Great Expectations expectation suite JSON files and presents the data in DataFrames for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Analyze expectation suites from Great Expectations\n",
        "- **Data Source**: JSON files stored in `BirdiDQ/gx/expectations/`\n",
        "- **Output**: Structured DataFrames for easy analysis and visualization\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Suite Metadata**: Name, version, expectation count, creation date\n",
        "- **Individual Expectations**: Detailed breakdown of all expectations\n",
        "- **Suite Summaries**: Aggregated views by suite and expectation type\n",
        "- **Column Coverage**: Which columns have expectations and how many\n",
        "- **Parameter Analysis**: Range values, mostly parameters, value sets\n",
        "- **Exports**: CSV files for further analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Findings:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Python Code in Expectations:**\n",
        "- Python code is embedded in the `meta.notes.content` field of each expectation\n",
        "- Format: Markdown with code blocks showing `validator.expect_*()` calls\n",
        "- Includes execution engine information (Pandas, SQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.)\n",
        "- Generated by Data Assistants or manually created\n",
        "\n",
        "**SQL Code:**\n",
        "- Great Expectations translates Python expectations to SQL when using database backends\n",
        "- SQL is generated at runtime, not stored in the JSON files\n",
        "- For databases: Python → Great Expectations → SQL queries\n",
        "- For files: Python → Pandas operations\n"
