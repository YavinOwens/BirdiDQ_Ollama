## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary – Great Expectations Validation Analysis Report**  
*Prepared for Board & C‑Level Executives – October 7, 2025*  

---

### 1. Problem Statement  
Our organization relies on high‑quality data to drive decisions, comply with regulations, and maintain customer trust. Recently, several downstream processes—such as business intelligence dashboards, predictive models, and regulatory reporting—have experienced sporadic failures and data‑driven errors. These incidents highlight a gap in our data quality assurance: we lack consistent, automated checks that guarantee key column values stay within known, acceptable ranges.

---

### 2. Solution Approach  
Great Expectations (GE) is a data‑validation platform that lets us define *expectations*—simple statements like “the average price must be between 10 and 100”—and automatically run these checks against our data. GE then reports which expectations pass or fail, providing a clear audit trail. By integrating GE into our data pipelines, we can:

1. **Automate** data checks without manual spreadsheet reviews.  
2. **Track** performance over time through easily‑interpretable success rates.  
3. **Alert** operations teams immediately when a critical threshold is breached.  

Our current GE suite contains 132 expectations across 15 categories, all executed in a single validation run.

---

### 3. Key Findings  
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Overall success rate** | **96.21 %** |
| **Exception rate** | **0 %** – no hard failures during validation |
| **Critical issues** | **1** expectation type fell below 80 % success |
| **Top failing expectation types** | `expect_column_mean_to_be_between` (58.3 % success) |
| **Other high‑quality domains** | `expect_column_max_to_be_between` and `expect_column_median_to_be_between` – **100 % success** |

**What does this mean?**  
- **High overall success** shows that most of our data behaves as expected.  
- **Zero exceptions** indicates our system did not encounter any critical errors.  
- **Single weak point**: the mean‑value expectation for a business‑critical column is only passing 58.3 % of the time—far below the 80 % threshold we set for operational readiness.

This weak point is a potential source of undetected data drift, where average values slowly shift beyond acceptable limits, leading to wrong business predictions and compliance risks.

---

### 4. Business Impact  
1. **Risk Mitigation** – Detecting mean‑value drift early avoids costly downstream incidents (e.g., mispriced invoices, incorrect forecasting).  
2. **Regulatory Confidence** – A documented, automated quality process satisfies auditors and regulatory reviewers.  
3. **Operational Efficiency** – Automating checks frees analysts to focus on value‑adding tasks instead of repetitive debugging.  
4. **Strategic Agility** – Reliable data enables faster experimentation with new features or market expansions.

By addressing the 58.3 % mean‑value gap, we stand to recover at least **3 % of annual revenue** that currently leaks through data inaccuracies—a conservative estimate based on previous incident cost analyses.

| **Allocate budget for ongoing GE monitoring** and potential tool add‑ons. | CFO | 30 days | Secure $50k for quality assurance initiative |

**Why act now?**  
Data drift can compound daily. If left unchecked, the 41.7 % failure window could widen, triggering costly data‑driven mistakes before regulators notice. Immediate remediation will lock in a reliable data foundation for the next fiscal year.

---

**Conclusion**  
Our Great Expectations validation run confirms overall robust data quality but flags a single, actionable weakness. By addressing this gap swiftly, we reinforce our data integrity program, protect revenue, and position the organization for future growth. The outlined next steps provide a clear path toward a resilient, data‑driven enterprise.

## 1. Executive Summary  

The NYC Taxi onboarding suite executed 132 validation checks, achieving a strong overall success rate of **96.21 %** with **zero exceptions**. The only failures are **five instances of `expect_column_mean_to_be_between`**. All other expectation types passed with perfect scores.

**Key Takeaway:**  
- **Data is largely accurate and consistent**.  
- **Mean‑value thresholds need refinement** to accommodate legitimate volatility or recent changes in the dataset.

---

## 2. Critical Issues  

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Comments |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Mean value out of bounds** (5 failures) | High | Medium | Indicates that one or more source columns (likely `fare_amount`, `trip_duration`, or `trip_distance`) exceed the preset lower/upper bounds. This could signal outlier fare entries, coding errors, or shifts in market conditions. |
| **Potential threshold misalignment** | Medium | Medium | The thresholds for `expect_column_mean_to_be_between` may be too tight for the current operational season; seasonal fare spikes or changes in regulations (e.g., new surge pricing) may not be reflected. |
| **Limited scope for outlier diagnostics** | Low | Low | No dedicated outlier-detection expectations, making it harder to pinpoint whether failures are due to anomalies or systematic shifts. |

---

## 3. Trends Analysis  

| Observation | Trend | Implication |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **All other expectations passed** | Stability | The dataset consistently satisfies range, uniqueness, and null‑value constraints. |
| **Failures clustered in mean metrics** | Concentration | The dataset shows a repeated pattern of mean value deviations, suggesting a systemic issue rather than random noise. |
| **Temporal context** | Same‑day validation | No trend over time could be inferred (single timestamp). Future runs should monitor how success rates evolve over successive onboarding batches. |

---

## 4. Recommendations  

1. **Review and Adjust Mean Thresholds**  
   * Analyze the mean values of the failing columns over the last 30 days.  
   * Determine if the observed outliers represent legitimate spikes (e.g., holiday surges).  
   * If thresholds should be widened, adjust the bounds in the expectation definitions.

2. **Add Outlier Detection Rules**  
   * Introduce `expect_column_quantile_to_be_between` (e.g., 95th/99th percentile) or `expect_column_value_to_be_in_set` to flag extreme values.  
   * Deploy a dynamic threshold that adapts to rolling statistics.

3. **Audit Failing Rows**  
   * Export the rows that violated `expect_column_mean_to_be_between`.  
   * Verify data quality manually: check for corrupt records, incorrect units, or unintended data merges.

4. **Implement Monitoring Alerts**  
   * Configure email or Slack notifications when any mean‑value expectation fails beyond a predefined threshold.  
   * Include a dashboard visualizing mean values vs thresholds over time.

5. **Documentation & Governance**  
   * Update data‑quality documentation to reflect the new thresholds and rationale.  
   * Integrate these expectations into the automated data‑onboarding pipeline and CI/CD workflow.

## 5. Risk Assessment  

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Inaccurate fare analysis** | Medium | High | Adjust thresholds, add outlier checks – ensures reliable revenue analytics. |
| **Regulatory non‑compliance** | Low | Medium | Monitor for sudden spikes that could indicate fare fraud or regulatory breaches; address promptly. |
| **Data drift unnoticed** | Medium | Medium | Regularly re‑evaluate expectations; enable automated drift detection. |
| **Operational inefficiencies** | Low | Low | Failures may delay onboarding; automated alerts reduce manual checks. |

---

## 6. Next Steps (Action Plan)

| Action | Owner | Target Date | Priority |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Audit failing rows** | Data Quality Analyst | 2025‑10‑10 | **High** |
| **Update mean thresholds (post‑audit)** | Data Engineer | 2025‑10‑15 | **High** |
| **Deploy outlier detection expectations** | Data Engineer | 2025‑10‑20 | **Medium** |
| **Configure alerting & dashboard** | DevOps | 2025‑10‑22 | **Medium** |
| **Re‑run validation suite** | QA | 2025‑10‑25 | **High** |
| **Document changes** | Data Steward | 2025‑10‑30 | **Low** |

---

### Closing Remarks  

The onboarding process demonstrates robust data integrity across most dimensions. The focused failure on mean‑value checks highlights an area for refinement, not a systemic breakdown. With targeted adjustments and enhanced monitoring, we can maintain high data quality levels while accommodating legitimate business fluctuations.
