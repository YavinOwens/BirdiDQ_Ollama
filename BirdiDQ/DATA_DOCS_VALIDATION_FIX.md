# Data Docs Validation Results Fix

## Problem
Expectations and validation results were **not showing up in Data Docs**. When users opened Data Docs, they could see:
- ✅ Expectation suites (list of expectations)
- ❌ **Missing**: Validation results (passed/failed status for each expectation)

## Root Cause
The `run_ge_checkpoint()` method was **only building Data Docs** without actually **running validation** against the data.

### The Broken Code:
```python
def run_ge_checkpoint(self, batch_request):
    """
    Run GE checkpoint using Fluent API - Don't use checkpoint, just validate directly
    """
    # Just build data docs - validation already happened when we called save_expectation_suite
    self.context.build_data_docs()  # ❌ No validation!
    
    return type('obj', (object,), {
        'success': True,
        'run_results': {}
    })()
```

### Why This Failed:
1. **Expectations were saved** to the suite ✅
2. **Validation never ran** ❌
3. **Data Docs only showed expectations** (no pass/fail results)
4. The comment "validation already happened" was **incorrect** - validation only happens when:
   - You call `validator.validate()`, OR
   - You run a checkpoint

## The Fix

### Updated Code:
```python
def run_ge_checkpoint(self, batch_request):
    """
    Run GE checkpoint to validate expectations and generate Data Docs with results
    """
    try:
        # Create/update checkpoint configuration
        self.add_or_update_ge_checkpoint()
        
        # Run checkpoint with validation - this will actually execute expectations
        print(f"Running checkpoint '{self.checkpoint_name}' to validate expectations...")
        checkpoint_result = self.context.run_checkpoint(
            checkpoint_name=self.checkpoint_name,
            validations=[
                {
                    "batch_request": batch_request,
                    "expectation_suite_name": self.expectation_suite_name,
                }
            ],
        )
        
        print(f"✓ Checkpoint executed: {checkpoint_result.success}")
        print(f"✓ Validation results saved to Data Docs")
        
        # Build data docs to show results
        self.context.build_data_docs()
        
        return checkpoint_result
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Checkpoint execution failed: {e}")
        # If checkpoint fails, still build docs with just expectations (no validation results)
        self.context.build_data_docs()
        
        # Return a mock checkpoint result
        return type('obj', (object,), {
            'success': False,
            'run_results': {}
        })()
```

### What Changed:
1. ✅ **Now calls `context.run_checkpoint()`** - Actually validates expectations
2. ✅ **Includes validation configuration** - Specifies which suite and data to validate
3. ✅ **Error handling** - Falls back gracefully if checkpoint fails
4. ✅ **Proper logging** - Shows checkpoint execution status

## How Great Expectations Validation Works

### The Workflow:
```
1. Create Expectation Suite
   ↓
2. Add Expectations to Suite
   ↓
3. Save Expectation Suite         ← We were stopping here! ❌
   ↓
4. Run Checkpoint/Validation      ← THIS WAS MISSING!
   ↓
5. Build Data Docs with Results   ← Now we get actual results! ✅
```

### Key Insight:
- **Saving expectations** ≠ **Validating expectations**
- Expectations are like "rules"
- Validation is "checking if data follows the rules"
- Data Docs need **both** to show meaningful results

## What Users Will See Now

### Before Fix:
```
Data Docs:
├── Expectation Suite: "TRANSACTIONS_expectation_suite"
│   ├── expect_column_values_to_not_be_null (column: TRANSACTION_ID)
│   └── expect_column_values_to_be_between (column: AMOUNT)
└── Validation Results: None ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
Data Docs:
├── Expectation Suite: "TRANSACTIONS_expectation_suite"
│   ├── ✅ expect_column_values_to_not_be_null (column: TRANSACTION_ID)
│   │   └── Result: PASSED - 0 unexpected values
│   └── ✅ expect_column_values_to_be_between (column: AMOUNT)
│       └── Result: PASSED - All values in range [0, 1000]
└── Validation Results: 2/2 expectations passed ✅
```

## Testing

### How to Verify:
1. **Run an expectation** in the Streamlit app:
   - Input: "TRANSACTION_ID should not be null"
   - Click "Run Quality Checks"

2. **Check terminal output** - You should now see:
   ```
   Running checkpoint 'TRANSACTIONS_checkpoint' to validate expectations...
   ✓ Checkpoint executed: True
   ✓ Validation results saved to Data Docs
   ```

3. **Open Data Docs** - You should see:
   - List of expectations ✅
   - **Validation results with pass/fail status** ✅
   - Statistics (e.g., "0 unexpected values") ✅
   - Graphs/charts showing data quality ✅

## Files Modified

1. **`connecting_data/database/oracle.py`**
   - Fixed `run_ge_checkpoint()` method
   - Now actually runs validation via checkpoint

2. **`connecting_data/database/postgresql.py`**
   - Applied same fix for consistency
   - Both databases now validate properly

## Impact

### For Users:
- ✅ **See actual validation results** in Data Docs
- ✅ **Know if expectations pass or fail**
- ✅ **Get statistical summaries** of data quality
- ✅ **Interactive reports** with detailed breakdowns

### For Development:
- ✅ **Follows GX best practices**
- ✅ **Checkpoints run as designed**
- ✅ **Consistent with notebook workflows**
- ✅ **Proper error handling**

## Related Issues

This fix resolves several related problems:
1. ❌ "Data Docs show no results"
2. ❌ "Expectations are created but not validated"
3. ❌ "Can't see pass/fail status"
4. ❌ "Validation metrics missing"

All of these were caused by skipping the checkpoint execution step.

## Key Takeaway

**In Great Expectations:**
- Creating expectations ≠ Validating data
- Always run `context.run_checkpoint()` or `validator.validate()` to get results
- Data Docs need validation results to show meaningful insights
- Checkpoints are the proper way to run validations in production workflows
